Themes I made for Audacity.


Installation
============

(Taken from http://jcsu.jesus.cam.ac.uk/~hdc21/design/audacity/)

To use these you'll need to enable 'Load Theme Cache At Startup'. In Audacity 1.3.3 this can be done by going to 'Edit > Preferences > Theme' however higher versions of Audacity no longer have this option; instead go to the audacity data directory:

* Windows: Documents and Settings\<user name>\Application Data\Audacity\
* OS X: ~/Library/Application Support/audacity/
* Linux: ~/.audacity-data/

and append the following to 'audacity.cfg':
```
[Theme]
LoadAtStart=1
```

Also, while in the audacity data directory create a folder called 'Theme' and place in it the ImageCache of your desired theme, renamed to 'ImageCache.png', and restart Audacity. Magic!
